This is a kind of "trash" repository where I will be depositing mostly all the homework and exercises related to markdown languages (+ others)
I've done during the short degree I took in Network Computer Systems Administration. Nothing valuable here, just the common and usual
Markup Language exercises for beginners that are usually used in school classes and you can find all over the internet.

They're here because why not? Perhaps they're useful for someone! :P

PS: Although all of this is simple homework without any real challenge, I took one project so far, which ended up being a the "Multimedia Database", 
which you can locate under the PHP folder. That one took a few days and it was a bit challenging because I only wanted to use pure PHP, no Javascript at all.
Maybe, after you take a look at it, you like it. All in all, perhaps you haven't lost your time reading this whole description for nothing valuable :P

PS 2: If you clicked on this and already read all of this, you're not a really "bored" person, just a person who cares about other's work, so don't feel bad! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰
