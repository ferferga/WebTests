# Web Tests

This is an archival repository where I have all the homework and exercises related to markdown languages (among others)
for the Network Computer Systems Administration degree I took. **There's probably nothing valuable here**, just the common and usual
*Markup Languages* exercises for beginners that are usually used in school classes and you can find all over the internet.

I make this public so hopefully there's someone who finds it useful in some way.

PS: Although all of this is simple beginner's homework, there's one project (which ended up being the "Multimedia Database", 
which you can locate under the PHP folder) that took a few days and it was a bit challenging because I only wanted to use pure PHP, no Javascript at all.

PS 2: If you kept reading up to this point (even though this repo is probably meaningless to 99% of the people): 
Thank you very much for caring enough! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰
