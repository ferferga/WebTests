In this game, the program generates a 4-distinct-digit number [1-9] (**1234** is ok, but not **1241**
or **0543**), randomly chosen. The player tries to guess this number through successive attempts.
Each attempt is also a 4-digit number. The program examines it, answering how many digits are
perfectly placed (correct answer) and how many are present but out of position (half correct
answer).


The player will have 8 attempts to try to win. In the last attempt, the addition of
the four digits is shown as a hint.
