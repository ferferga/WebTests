This PHP code consists in three pages:

## First screen

On the first screen we will ask the user:

- Username.
- Profile image.
- Favourite colour.
- Province of residence.

The page will have two buttons below: one to access the favourite colour screen and another
one to access the province of residence screen. The number of pages that have been visited so
far will also be displayed.

## Second screen

On the second screen we will show the username and the image of the user entered on the
first screen, as well as the user’s favourite colour and the number of pages visited.
We will also display two buttons: one to access the first screen (data entry) and another one to
access the province screen (screen 3).

## Third screen

On the third screen we will show the username and the profile user’s image, as well as the
user’s residence province and the number of pages visited.
We will also have two buttons: one to access each of the other two pages.
