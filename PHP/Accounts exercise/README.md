This PHP is aimed at being a demonstration of PHP classes and methods. Description of the methods:

- deposit(): To increase the balance with a quantity set as a parameter.
- withdraw(): To decrease the balance with a quantity set as a parameter.
- transfer(): To move some quantity to another account.
